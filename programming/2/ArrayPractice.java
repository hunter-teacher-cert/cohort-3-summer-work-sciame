/**
 * Friday July 1, 2022 
ArrayPractice.java by Breakout Room 8

 * Greg Sciame
* collaborators: Nicole Cojuango, Parmanand Mohanlall, Saranii Muller

(Our group didn't finish all the basic
exercises during class, but we were talking
through the details the whole time...some
people want every detail to be explained, and
I'm looking at it as an opportunity to practice
teaching, and to try and make the best of
it...so Saranii added a lot of comments for
clarification as we were going over what each
line meant.  Nicole and Parmanand were
helpful with feedback, bouncing ideas & looking
up resources, etc...for example Nicole
recognized that the code we needed to use for
the printArray() method had similarities to the
histogram prework problem...so we repurposed a
bit of her code from that and changed the array
name to match our code...and Pramanand knew how
to do some of these array operations in python,
so he was looking up python example solutions 
for possible reference, and we were also
looking at the PDF of Dr. Sakas's slides to get
some ideas...one of the TAs popped in and we
asked the TA to hang out longer since we were
stuck here and there...I am comfortable with
Java half the time, since it is similar in many
ways to JavaScript and I teach intro to JS as
part of my curriculum...but unless a student in
the breakout room is more comfortable with Java
than me...then it takes decent time to figure
out which differences in Java from JavaScript
are causing me hiccups...I was nervous on day
0, but the more I realize that I am a student
instead of the teacher, I am increasingly more
excited to come to class & learn more and build
cool projects in the future:)

   INSTRUCTIONS:
   This file contains stubs (empty methods) for the following methods:

   1. buildIncreasingArray
   2. buildRandomArray
   3. printArray
   4. arraySum
   5. firstOccurence
   6. isSorted
   7. findMaxValue
   8. countOdds
   9. flip

   The stubs will have comments describing what they should do

   Levels:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Basic:
   Complete these methods:
   - buildRandomArray line 85-93 üëç (solved this together as a group)
   - printArray line 109 üëç (solved this together as a group)
   - arraySum line 147 üëç (solved this together as a group)
   - firstOccurence line 129 ...üëç (figured this out by looking at Jihae Park's code)
   - findMaxValue line 184 üëç (I got this working after analyzing Joshua Higgin's repo)

   Intermediate:
   Complete all the methods for basic and also
   - buildIncreasingArray
