   INSTRUCTIONS:
   Place this file in a folder named programming/3/.
   This file contains the following completed method. Use it as a model
   to help you with the other methods:
   - buildBoard
   This file also contains stubs (empty methods) for the following
   methods (split into 3 levels):
   Basic level (complete all):
   - printBoard *
   - copyBoard *
   Intermediate level (complete Basic methods plus this method):
   - explodeSquare *
   Advanced level (complete Basic + Intermediate + these two methods):
   - explodeAllChar *
   - downString
   The routines with the * will be particularly helpful for the
   Conway's Game of Life project that you'll work on after this one.

     Given the 2D array
     QQQQQ
     QQQQQ
     QQQQQ
     QQQQQ
     explodeSquare(board,1,1) will change the array to
     XXXQQ

     Note: Make sure to correctly handle the cases when you try
     to explode an element on the edges.
