exercise 1:

loop execution table:
i     n
============ 
10   10
5    10

3.)
yes, this loop terminates for any positive value of n because after the nth iteration of the loop, eventually i==1 which is the criteria  for breaking out of the loop because 'while(i>1)' doesn't execute when i==1, since i==1 does not meet the criteria of 'while(i>1)'.
