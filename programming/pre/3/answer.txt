//4***baffle() method invoked...next time baffle() is invoked, we know it prints wug, calls ping()which adds a . ((+"wug."))
    baffle();
//8***"You wugga " is printed on a new line with the introduction of a new System.out.print()
    System.out.print("You wugga ");
//9*** baffle() is invoked, which uses ping() and concatenates "wug." to make line 2 read: "You wugga wug.\n" there is a line break because  ping() uses System.out.println(".")...so the ln means to break the line after the String in the parentheses is concatenated.
//up to this point the message reads: "No, I wug.\n" + "You wugga wug.\n"
    baffle();
