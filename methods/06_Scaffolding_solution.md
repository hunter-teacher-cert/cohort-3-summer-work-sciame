# Scaffolding Activity
#### by Saranii Muller & Greg Sciame

### Technique: Scratch "Remix" (Do then change)

#### Well-suited to...Introducing Scratch early in the year
* When first starting out, or if students are feeling lost.

#### Example
* Give students some Scratch blocks or existing code to get started, but NOT ALL of the blocks. 
* Include instructions in the comments (get ghost to move to a position and get casey to change costumes repeatedly forever)
